    (this is linearly spaced, if you want
    logarithmic, and are not doing a sample
    that has two very different T₁ values, you
    should really question your life choices.)

    Parameters
    ----------

    T1_max:
        The maximum T₁ value that you might
        expect.  For ODNP, this typically means
        the same as hot T₁.
        (In Weiss, you think about having a T₁
        in some possible range of values, and
        figuring out what it actually is.)
    T1_min:
        The minimum T₁ value that you might
        expect.
        For ODNP, this is typically the value
        expected at 17 or 18°C.
    startconstant:
        Fraction of minimum T₁ bounds to start
        vdlist at (0.15 recommended).
        (from Weiss, where T₁ determination problem is treated as determining
        the T₁, which is known to be between some min and max bounds)
    stopconstant:
        Fraction of max T₁ bounds to stop vdlist at.

        Weiss recommends 0.75, which only gives 5% recovery -- we choose 2.0,
        since it gives 73% recovery, and that makes us feel better
