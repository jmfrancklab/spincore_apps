# spincore_apps

This package contains a very convenient extension that wraps the SpinCore API for collecting NMR data.  Data collection is automated by the examples in the repo using a configuration file that contains al necessary parameters for a given NMR experiment using a very simple and flexible pulse programming language (based on [doi:10.1016/j.jmr.2013.07.015](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2013.07.015) with some upgrades). The data is then saved using [pyspecdata](https://jmfrancklab.github.io/pyspecdata) for convenience and extensibility. 

The documentation is not extensive, and unrelated files freely available from SpinCore are currently included, but feel free to contact us jmfranck [at] syr.edu

This code was primarily developed by A Beaton and A Guinness in the Franck lab at Syracuse University.

A manuscript describing implementation of this library in the context of Overhauser DNP is forthcoming.
